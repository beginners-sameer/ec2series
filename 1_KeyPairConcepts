Cryptography - secure information and apply some mathematics technique with some algorithms to txer messages so it can hard to decipher
Encryption - ordinary text to cipher text
Decryption - Cipher text to Ordinary text

Cryptograpy Life cycle:
Plaintext -> Encryption -> ciphertext -> Decryption -> Plaintext

Types of Cryptography:

single key or symmetric  - same key used to encrypt and decrypt - ex: AES

Symmetric vs Asymmetric:
sym =  plaintext -> secret key -> ciphertext -> same secret key -> plaintext
Asym = plaintext -> PubKeyEnc -> ciphertext -> PriKeyEnc -> plaintext

PublicKey/Asym :
      Pair of Keys
      public key to encrypt
      private key to decrypt
      Ex: RSA
        ECDSA
        DS

AWS EC2 Key Pair:
      KP = Public + Private Key Pair
      public key will be stored on your ec2 instance
      private key will be downloaded/saved by you when you create an instance
